## Development Setup

### GitHub Copilot Setup
If you're using GitHub Copilot (included in the GitHub Student Developer Pack) and **can't see agents** or only see "Edit" and "Ask" options, please refer to our comprehensive setup guide:

📖 **[GitHub Copilot Setup Guide](COPILOT_SETUP.md)**

**Important:** Agents are accessed by typing `@` in the chat input, not through menu buttons! See the setup guide for details.

This guide includes:
- Step-by-step installation instructions
- How to enable and access GitHub Copilot agents (@workspace, @vscode, @terminal)
- Troubleshooting for "I only see Edit and Ask, not Agent"
- Tips for using Copilot with this project
